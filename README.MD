# The Bard - Discord Bot
In the latest years all of the most famous _BOTS_ players of music was shut down by YouTube, Spotify and other music platforms. The Bard is a Discord Bot that you can add at your server to deal with this problem. The Bard is a bot that plays music from YouTube, and it's free to use.
Of course, we donÂ´t want the BOT be shut down, so we are not going to provide a public link to add it to your server. But you can clone this repository and run it on your own server.

## Features
- Play music from YouTube - [!play <song url from youtube>]
- Skip music - [!skip]
- Stop music - [!stop]
- Show the queue - [!queue]
- Show the help message - [!help]
- Roll a dice - [!roll <quantity of dices>d<dice faces><options>] (e.g: !roll 2d6+3)

## How to run
